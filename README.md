# TrainSim
Concurrent Programming course, 2017

A highly concurrent simulator of arbitrary railway networks.
It can simulate:
* Trains travelling between stations in predefined cycles
* Occasional failures of network elements  (tracks and junctions) as well as trains
* Autonomous repair teams for dealing with the failures
* Jobs being generated randomly at stations
* Workers travelling the network between their homes and job locations
